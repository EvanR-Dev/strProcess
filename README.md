# strProcess

A simple demonstration of string manipulation in C/C++.
For reference in the future when working with C, as Java's
string manipulation is more intuitive.

A file of sentences will be read in and the lines will be stored into a vector of strings.
For each string, print it, then report the number of chars in the string/sentence (string's length)
Then, count the number if words in each sentence
Then, count the number of vowels, the number of consonants, and number of punctutation or other chars in the string
Then convert the text in each line to Title Case, Sentence Case and Toggle Case
